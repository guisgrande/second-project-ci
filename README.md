## Deployment

- To create this project I used GitHub and GitPod.
- I used the [Code Institute Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template), clicking on the "Use this template" button. From there I created the repository on Github with my username.
- These commands were used for version control during project:
    * git status - to check the status of the files to be commited.
    * git add filename - to add files before committing.
    * git commit -m "message" - to commit changes to the local repository.
    * git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.
